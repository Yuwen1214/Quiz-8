## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### 1.Particle Plotter by Vamoss
I'm inspired by the generative art project [Particle Plotter by Vamoss](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/751983).
This work uses particles to form flowing patterns on the canvas, creating a strong dynamic visual rhythm, and the use of bold and bright colors. I hope to apply this flowing image structure to my assignment to express emotional fluctuations. This technology has advantages in generative images, which meets the assignment's requirements for exploring dynamic visual language.

### 2.Ink Chromatography by Ivan Rudnicki
I'm inspired by the generative art project[Ink Chromatography” by Ivan Rudnicki](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2613929)
This work simulates the effect of ink spreading in water. I like the natural smudge effect. I hope to use this gradient and diffusion image to express emotions. This technology of simulating physical media gives people a very intuitive visual change, which meets the requirements of the assignment for beauty and creativity.

### 3."HPV1" by -RobA> (aka Cartocopia)
I'm inspired by the generative art project["HPV1" by -RobA> (aka Cartocopia)](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2563161)
This work shows the growth process of linear patterns, with dense graphic structures and rhythmic layouts. I hope to learn from this way of image composition and use it as the background of the pattern. This kind of image has visual complexity, making the work more ornamental and meeting the requirements of the assignment for beauty and creativity.

## 2.Coding Technique Exploration

### 1.Particle Plotter by Vamoss
This work is based on p5.js, and generates a flowing pattern by continuously updating the particle position and controlling the angle. The noise() function is used to create natural disturbances, and frameCount is combined to achieve dynamic visuals that change over time. I plan to use this method as a decoration and embellishment in the work to complete the generated dynamic image.

### 2.Ink Chromatography by Ivan Rudnicki
This work uses pixel-level image processing to simulate ink diffusion through loadPixels() and updatePixels() operations, producing a gradient diffusion effect. I hope to use this technology to make the work have a richer visual experience, such as using this effect in the background.

### 3."HPV1" by -RobA> (aka Cartocopia)
This work uses the particle effect in p5.js to simulate cell-like expansion by controlling the random position and growth rules of particles. It uses cyclic transformation to generate dense distribution of images to form a bionic structure. I hope to use this kind of generative technology as an embellishment in my work to make the picture rich, layered and more visually attractive.
